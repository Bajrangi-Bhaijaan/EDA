I have populated the daily price returns of NIFTY50 (INDEX) for 16 years - 2007 to 2022.

Seeing the return distribution, does it ring a bell? HISTOGRAM / normal distribution.

You can see that the return distribution looks very much like the normal distribution. And this is true not just for NIFTY50 but also for other companies.

The normality of equity returns is one of the primary reasons quants and stats are used so much in finance.

People have built Nobel prize-winning valuation models around these normality assumptions, and investors build portfolios based on these simplistic assumptions.

But here's the catch.

Based on this assumption of normality, a simple calculation would show that the probability of a single-day fall for NIFTY50 of more than 9% is 0.0%. i.e., such an event should happen once in millions of years.
And by the way, this happened twice in 2020.

I am not against the use of quants and stats in finance. But blindly believing in simplistic assumptions and building levered portfolios based on them will surely not end well.

Finance and investing, in my opinion, is a subject of social science, not pure science. And I love to learn it that way.
